extension DependencyContainer {

  /**
   Resolves dependencies of passed in instance.
   Use this method to resolve dependencies of object created by storyboard.
   The type of the instance should be registered in the container.
   
   You should call this method only when you override default implementation of
   `didInstantiateFromStoryboard(_:tag:)` of `StoryboardInstantiatable` protocol.

   This method will do the same as `resolve(tag:)`, but instead of creating new intance
   it will use passed in instance as resolved instance.
   
   - parameters:
      - instance: The object which dependencies should be resolved
      - tag: An optional tag used to register the type (`T`) in the container
   
   **Example**:
   
   ```swift
   class ViewController: UIViewController, ServiceDelegate {
     var service: Service?
   }
   
   container.register(tag: "vc") { ViewController() }
     .resolveDependencies { container, controller in
       controller.service = try container.resolve() as Service
       controller.service.delegate = controller
   }

   class ServiceImp: Service {
     weak var delegate: ServiceDelegate?
   }

   container.register { ServiceImp() as Service }
   
   let controller = ...
   container.resolveDependencies(controller, tag: "vc")
   //controller.service?.delegate === controller
   ```
   
   - seealso: `register(tag:_:factory:)`, `didInstantiateFromStoryboard(_:tag:)`
   
   */
  public func resolveDependenciesOf<T>(instance: T, tag: Tag? = nil) throws {
    try resolve(tag: tag) { (factory: () throws -> T) in instance }
  }
  
}

public protocol StoryboardInstantiatable {
  
  /**
   This method will be called if you set a `dipTag` attirbute on the object in a storyboard.
   
   - parameters:
      - tag: The tag value, that was set on the object in a storyboard
      - container: The `DependencyContainer` associated with storyboards

   The type that implements this protocol should be registered in `UIStoryboard.container`.
   Default implementation of that method calls `resolveDependenciesOf(_:tag:)`
   and pass it `self` instance and the tag.

   Usually you will not need to override the default implementation of this method
   if you registered the type of the instance as a concret type in the container.
   Then you only need to add conformance to `StoryboardInstantiatable`.

   You may want to override it if you want to add custom logic before/after resolving dependencies
   or you want to resolve the instance as implementation of some protocol which it conforms to.
   
   - warning: This method will be called after `init?(coder:)` but before `awakeFromNib` method.
              Thus the instance may be not completely setup yet.

   **Example**:
   
   ```swift
   extension MyViewController: SomeProtocol { ... }
   
   extension MyViewController: StoryboardInstantiatable {
     func didInstantiateFromStoryboard(container: DependencyContainer, tag: DependencyContainer.Tag) {
       //resolve dependencies of the instance as SomeProtocol type
       try! container.resolveDependenciesOf(self as SomeProtocol, tag: tag)
       //do some additional setup here
     }
   }
   ```
